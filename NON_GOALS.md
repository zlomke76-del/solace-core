# NON_GOALS

This document defines what Solace Core is explicitly **not** intended to do.
These exclusions are permanent by design.

Solace Core is a runtime execution authority, not a general AI system or governance framework.

---

## Out of Scope by Design

Solace Core will not:

- Generate language, explanations, or recommendations
- Perform reasoning, planning, optimization, or search
- Maintain memory, user profiles, or identity graphs
- Learn, adapt, or self-modify its authority behavior
- Execute tools, workflows, or external side effects
- Orchestrate agents or manage multi-step tasks
- Provide user interfaces, dashboards, or operator UX
- Replace human judgment, approval, or accountability
- Act autonomously in the world

---

## Explicitly Not Roadmap Items

The following are not future features of Solace Core:

- “Smarter” authority via learning or feedback loops
- Confidence-based or probabilistic permissioning
- Embedded governance inside model prompts
- Automatic resolution of escalations
- Soft-fail or degraded execution modes
- Policy interpretation via natural language

Any system that performs these functions belongs outside Solace Core.

## Architectural Principle

Solace Core exists to decide **whether execution may occur**, not how to execute, what to optimize, or what outcome to pursue.

Authority is intentionally narrow.
Power comes from enforceability, not breadth.
